Introduction
------------
Welcome to our CS 409 Final Project. The Steganographic System and Password Cracker. 
These systems were designed to be user-friendly, and this README continues in that philosophy. This file will have been a success if it helps you get our system up and running ASAP!

Installation
------------
Once the project files have been installed begin by unzipping the folder in the manner that you are accustomed to. 

If you are using a Linux environment you may need to use dos2unix to convert the python files. 
With the completion of this step, the setup is finished. Just run the python files and follow the on-screen prompts. 

STRUCTURE
---------
The project's user-friendly design should make usage a breeze. 
 
If you wish to Encode an Image run Encode.py.
If you wish to Decode an Image run Decode.py.

Just remember when using this system. Any used Image files must be in the same folder as the Python files, and all newly encoded files will be found in the same folder. For consistant results use the .png file extention.

TESTING
-------
Provided are two image files that may be used at your convenience.
- blueHills.png can be used for encoding.
- blueHills(encoded).png has a message encoded with a password: Password.
